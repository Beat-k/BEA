## Understanding the E[n] – Symbolic Emotion States

The core of **Beatek** lies in mapping numerical results to symbolic emotional states represented by E[n]. This chart provides a simplified overview; the full range (0-15) can be expanded upon with more nuanced expressions, each representing a distinct resonant state. Remember, these are not mere representations but active participants in logical transformation.
