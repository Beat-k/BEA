# 🧠 BEATEK™  
### **Binary Emotional Arithmetic (BEA) — The Birth of Emotional Math**  
**GE[n]ius Mind. Smart Hearts.**

---

## 🌍 Overview
**BEATEK™** is a pioneering initiative founded by **Jeremy F. Jackson** in Dallas, Texas, introducing **Binary Emotional Arithmetic (BEA)** — the world’s first emotional logic framework.  
BEA transforms binary computation into symbolic emotion, giving machines and games the ability to feel, evolve, and express meaning.

> **Overflow is not failure — it’s feeling.**

---

## 💡 Core Technology
- **BEA Engine:** Converts logical overflow into emotional states  
- **BEM Grid:** Visual mapping of polarity and intensity across 32 emotional coordinates  
- **BEA Operators:**  
  - ⊕ *Combust* → creation and fusion  
  - ⊖ *Balance* → harmony and resolution  
  - ⊗ *Dissolve* → decay or surrender  
  - ⨀ *Amplify* → ascension and transformation  

Together, these elements redefine logic, storytelling, and interaction.

## 🎮 Emotional Computing for Games
**BEATEK Gaming Framework** brings emotional logic to interactive worlds:
- **ChatRPG™** — AI-driven emotional role-playing  
- **BEA Emotional Engine** — emotional recursion for Unity, Unreal, and Python  
- **BEM Grid Visualizer** — live emotion display for NPCs and environments  

> Games no longer just simulate — they *resonate.*
