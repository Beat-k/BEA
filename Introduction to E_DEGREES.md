# E° (E Degrees) - Emotional Temperature Guide

## What is E° (Emotional Temperature)?

**E° (E Degrees)** is BEA Speakerbox's intuitive metric for measuring your **emotional engagement** during gaming. Think of it like a thermometer for your gaming state - it tells you how "hot" or "cool" your emotional energy is running.

Just like how 98.6°F (37°C) is normal human body temperature, **80°E is the healthy baseline for competitive FPS gaming** - not a fever, but the optimal "in the zone" state.

---

## The E° Temperature Scale

### Recalibrated for Competitive Gaming

Based on real-world Rainbow Six Siege gameplay data, the E° scale has been calibrated to reflect actual gaming behavior:

| Temperature Range | State | Color | What It Means |
|-------------------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **0-30°E** | ❄️ FROZEN | 🔵 Blue | Low engagement, idle in menus, AFK, learning mechanics |
| **30-60°E** | 🧊 COOL | 🔷 Cyan | Casual gaming, exploring, low-pressure scenarios |
| **60-80°E** | ✅ NORMAL | 🟢 Green | **Active competitive gaming** - the stable "in the zone" range |
| **80-90°E** | 🔥 WARM | 🟡 Yellow | Intense focus, clutch moments, high-stakes rounds |
| **90-95°E** | 🌡️ HOT | 🟣 Magenta | Peak performance under pressure, adrenaline rush |
| **95-100°E** | 🌋 BOILING | 🔴 Red | Emotional overload, tilting, need a break |

### Key Insight: 80°E is Like 98.6°F

Just like how human body temperature sits around 98.6°F (37°C) when healthy, **80°E represents optimal competitive gaming engagement**:

- **Below 60°E**: You're warming up, learning, or taking it easy
- **60-80°E**: You're actively playing and engaged (normal competitive range)
- **80°E exactly**: The "sweet spot" - fully immersed, high performance, stable emotions
- **80-90°E**: Peak intensity - clutch plays, high-pressure situations
- **Above 95°E**: Overheating - emotional chaos, frustration, tilt

**Bottom Line**: Don't panic if you see 80°E! That's your body running at a healthy 98.6°F equivalent.

## How E° is Calculated

### The Formula

E° combines three key emotional metrics with weighted importance:

```
E° = (Average Intensity × 70%) + (Emotional Velocity × 20%) + (Coherence Loss × 10%)
```

### What Each Component Measures

1. **Average Intensity (70% weight)** - Base emotional energy
   - How strong your emotions are running (0.0-1.0 scale)
   - The primary driver of temperature
   - Example: High intensity during combat = higher E°

2. **Emotional Velocity (20% weight)** - Rate of emotional change
   - How quickly you're switching between emotions
   - Adds "engagement heat" to the temperature
   - Calm transitions = lower contribution
   - Chaotic switching = higher contribution
   - Max contribution: +15°E

3. **Coherence Loss (10% weight)** - Emotional instability
   - Measures how inconsistent your emotional state is
   - Minor factor that adds slight heat during chaos
   - Max contribution: +5°E

### Example Calculation

Let's say during a Siege match:
- Your average intensity is 0.70 (70% emotional energy)
- Your emotional velocity is 0.60 (moderate switching)
- Your coherence is 0.40 (60% loss)

```
Base temp from intensity: 0.70 × 100 = 70°E
Velocity heat:           0.60 × 15 = 9°E
Coherence loss heat:     0.60 × 5 = 3°E

E° = (70 × 0.7) + (9 × 0.2) + (3 × 0.1)
E° = 49 + 1.8 + 0.3
E° = 51.1°E → COOL state
```

## E° vs Other BEA Metrics

### How E° Relates to the Full Resonance Report

E° is a **simplified summary** of your emotional state. It complements the other metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures | How It Affects E° |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Emotional Resonance** | Overall audio-emotion alignment | Indirectly affects intensity component |
| **Temporal Coherence** | Emotional consistency over time | Low coherence → higher E° (via coherence loss) |
| **Spatial Presence** | Directional audio quality | Does not directly affect E° |
| **Harmonic Balance** | Audio frequency quality | Does not directly affect E° |
| **Emotional Velocity** | Rate of emotion changes | Directly contributes +20% to E° |

### When to Use Each Metric

- **Use E° for**: Quick "am I in the zone?" checks, tilt monitoring, break decisions
- **Use Emotional Velocity for**: Detecting chaotic gameplay or emotional instability
- **Use Temporal Coherence for**: Measuring emotional consistency and decision quality
- **Use Spatial Presence for**: Audio quality and footstep detection effectiveness

---

## Technical Details

### Implementation

E° is calculated by the **BEA Resonance Operator** (`BEA_Resonance_Operator.py`):

```python
def get_emotional_temperature(self) -> float:
    """Calculate Emotional Temperature in E° (E degrees)."""
    if len(self.emotion_history) == 0:
        return 70.0  # Default to active gaming baseline

    intensities = list(self.intensity_history)
    avg_intensity = float(np.mean(intensities)) if len(intensities) > 0 else 0.5

    # Base temperature from intensity (0.0-1.0 → 0-100°E)
    base_temp = avg_intensity * 100.0

    # Velocity adds engagement heat
    velocity_heat = self.emotional_velocity * 15.0

    # Coherence loss adds minor instability
    coherence_loss = (1.0 - self.current_coherence) * 5.0

    # Final temperature (weighted)
    temperature = (base_temp * 0.7) + (velocity_heat * 0.2) + (coherence_loss * 0.1)

    return float(max(0.0, min(100.0, temperature)))
```

### Recalibration History

**Original Scale (Pre-Recalibration):**
- Based on human body temp analogy (37°E = normal)
- 80°E was marked as "HOT" (red warning)
- Velocity contributed up to 30°E
- Coherence contributed up to 20°E

**Problem:** User reported stable 80°E during competitive gaming, but it showed as "overheating"

**Recalibrated Scale (Current):**
- Based on actual gaming data (80°E = normal competitive)
- 60-80°E is "NORMAL" (green, healthy range)
- Velocity contributes up to 15°E (reduced)
- Coherence contributes up to 5°E (reduced)
- Default baseline: 37°E → 70°E

**Result:** 80°E now correctly represents "in the zone" gaming, like 98.6°F for the human body.

## FAQs

### Q: Is 80°E bad? Should I be worried?

**A: No! 80°E is like your body running at 98.6°F - it's the healthy baseline for competitive gaming.**

The scale was recalibrated based on real-world data. If you're stably at 80°E during Siege matches, you're in the optimal zone.

---

### Q: What if my E° is always low (30-50°E)?

**A:** You might be:
- Playing casually (which is fine!)
- Not fully engaged with the audio
- In menus or lobby more than active gameplay
- Using low-intensity playstyle (support, anchor, etc.)

**This isn't bad** - it just means you're not in high-pressure competitive mode. If you want higher engagement, try ranked matches or focus on aggressive plays.

---

### Q: My E° jumps from 70°E to 95°E in seconds. Is that normal?

**A:** Short spikes are normal during:
- Sudden enemy encounters
- Clutch situations (1v4, defuser down, etc.)
- Getting flanked or surprised

**However**, if it stays at 95°E for extended periods or you're seeing 70°E → 95°E → 60°E → 90°E rapidly cycling, you might be:
- Tilting or frustrated
- In a very chaotic match
- Experiencing high emotional velocity (bad for decision-making)

**Recommendation:** Take a break to reset your emotional state.

---

### Q: Can I lower my E° intentionally?

**A:** Yes! Try:
- **Deep breathing** between rounds
- **Muting toxic teammates** to reduce stress
- **Taking 2-3 minute breaks** between matches
- **Switching to casual mode** if ranked is too intense
- **Adjusting audio settings** (lower volume can reduce intensity)

---

### Q: What's the ideal E° range for competitive play?

**A:** **60-80°E** is the sweet spot:
- **Below 60°E**: Not fully engaged, might be distracted
- **60-75°E**: Good competitive state, balanced emotions
- **75-85°E**: Peak engagement, "in the zone"
- **Above 90°E**: Overheating, performance likely declining

**The magic number: 80°E** - your gaming body temperature.

---

### Q: Does E° affect audio enhancement?

**A:** No, E° is a **monitoring metric**, not a control parameter. BEA's audio enhancement works independently.

E° helps **you** understand your emotional state so you can:
- Decide when to take breaks
- Monitor tilt and frustration
- Optimize your mental performance

The Siege MCP Server's audio enhancements (footstep boost, spatial enhancement, etc.) run regardless of your E°.

---

### Q: Why does E° sometimes not match how I feel?

**A:** E° measures **audio-derived emotional inference**, not your actual feelings. It's based on:
- Audio intensity patterns
- Emotional transitions BEA detects
- Coherence of emotional states

If there's a mismatch, it might mean:
- Your game audio doesn't reflect your emotions (e.g., calm audio during tense moment)
- BEA is picking up background noise or music
- Your emotional expression is internal (thinking/strategizing without audio cues)

**E° is most accurate during active gameplay** with typical game sounds (footsteps, gunfire, callouts).
